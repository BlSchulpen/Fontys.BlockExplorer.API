Main test takes ~18min

-Getting the addresses hashes from the block takes ~15ms (Not a problem)
-Getting distinct addresses takes  ~ 3seconds (A bit to large)
-Save distinct addresses  ~3seconds (No meaningfull change)
- Do all but return list, thus overide addresses: Likely seems to be about 17 seonds ased on before run
